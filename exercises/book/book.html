      The excerpt from the book “understanding adjustment and behavior” discusses the psychology of different personalities. Although I already knew about this, it was interesting to read about how children growing up are affected by their surroundings and environment. Their personality is developed from the people around them and how their surroundings make them feel. What I didn’t know was that psychologically, personality consists of every attitude, trait, and attribute that come together in the totality of our psychological makeup.

      A long long time ago, personality types were divided into only four descriptions. It’s insane to think that they imagined every person in the world would fall into one of these four categories. Although it is mentioned that each person is unique in their own way, they definitely didn’t realize how diverse the spectrum was. Reading on, we started to get into “this or that” categories such as introvert or extrovert, optimist or pessimist, etc. It was pointed out that although someone may be considered an introvert, that doesn’t mean they are not extroverted in the slightest; people can be a mix of one and the other.

As studies progressed, scientists explored the correlation between one’s physical figure and their natural being. This was super weird to think that people are a certain way because of the shape of their physical appearance.
