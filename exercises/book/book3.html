    <p>
      Frustration, meaning the blocking of
      goal-directed behavior, is an inevitable
      consequence of learning to adjust
      to the reality of living with others
    </p>
  </div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="B"> <p>
        There is no single response to frustration.
        It leads to a number of responses including
        aggressive ones as well as those that
        are incompatible with aggression.     </p>
  </div>
  <br><br>
  <div class="C"> <p>
    Aggression is best understood through the frustration-aggression hypothesis. This hypothesis is based on two complementary assumptions: the occurrence of frustration always leads to a tendency for an organism to respond aggressively. Second, whenever an organism responds aggressively, this in and of itself is evidence of underlying frustration.
</div>
  <br><br>
  <div class="D"> <p>
    Aggressive urges are consequently displaced
    displaced when the frustration source cannot
    be directly attacked… an organism may
    broaden its reaction to include all sorts
    of situations not originally involved. </p>
</div>
<br><br>
<div class="E"> <p>
  An adult male extremely frustrated by his wife and unable to express aggression directly against her may find satisfaction in being hostile to his secretary. Since these aggressive responses are unrestrained, he may learn to generalize them to all his employees and others who are subordinate to him.    </p>
</div>
<div class="F"> <p>
Directions of aggression:</div>
<div class="G"> <p>
Extrapunitive: individual blames the external world, reacts with anger and hostility toward others, and strikes out against them.</div>
<div class="H"> <p>
Intropunitive: individual blames himself, reacts with feelings of remorse and guilt, or otherwise tries to correct his own behavior</div>
<div class="I"> <p>
Impunity: individual passes over frustrating situations making light of the fact as if they were accidents and no one or anything is to blame</div>

<div class="J"> <p>
Anxiety should be distinguished from the simple word fear. Fear connotes fright attached to a specific stimulus or event. Anxiety is more diffuse and vague. Often it is difficult to pinpoint or name the source of the serious uneasiness an individual may be experiencing

</div>
<div class="K"> <p>
Fear is immediate whereas anxiety is an anticipatory feeling. One fears something now. Anxiety is a vague foreboding, like being extremely worried about one’s ability to successfully complete college long before one is actually enrolled.
