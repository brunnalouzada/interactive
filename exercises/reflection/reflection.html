      To begin, this article made me ponder on the possibilities and specifications of the relationship between art and the digital. It prompted me to think about how we associate digital things on the computer and how we associate art in general as a mostly hand-made medium. Graphic design is something more complex that falls neither in one nor the other, but somewhere in the in-between. Once you look further into it, graphic design is an enormous umbrella with different routes of possibilities.
      <br><br>
      Continuing on, the ideas became more complex and discussed the identification of context versus content, which allowed me to identify what the content of my designs are and what further context it holds. A phrase that resonated with me was Marshall McLuhan‘s quote, “the medium is the message.” It was really interesting and fun to see images of art and shapes created through text and glyphs! The one that looked like a counting abacus reminded me of a project we did in GD4(?) with Emily about “misusing software.” I also clicked into websites from the text like LinhedIn.com, Vodacone.com, and YouTuhb.com to experience what the writer was trying to convey.
      <br><br>
      Another thing that interested me was reading about unicode, which brought me back to my middle school days when I used to text my friends on kik with little stick men made from o’s and backslashes. I found it super cool that the computer understands to associate a specific glyph with its meaning- for example, how it knows that ε corresponds to the greek alphabet epsilon, but is also used as a fancy e. This is similar to how we look at icons nowadays. After reading this, Jodi are very impressive and truly clever artists and to end,  I really resonated with this quote that states net art never quite fit into the master narratives of art, or technology.”

            <summary id="dropdown2">"Understanding Adjustment & Behavior"</summary>
      <div class="middlep2">
        <p>
          The excerpt from the book “understanding adjustment and behavior” discusses the psychology of different personalities. Although I already knew about this, it was interesting to read about how children growing up are affected by their surroundings and environment. Their personality is developed from the people around them and how their surroundings make them feel. What I didn’t know was that psychologically, personality consists of every attitude, trait, and attribute that come together in the totality of our psychological makeup.
          <br><br>
          A long long time ago, personality types were divided into only four descriptions. It’s insane to think that they imagined every person in the world would fall into one of these four categories. Although it is mentioned that each person is unique in their own way, they definitely didn’t realize how diverse the spectrum was. Reading on, we started to get into “this or that” categories such as introvert or extrovert, optimist or pessimist, etc. It was pointed out that although someone may be considered an introvert, that doesn’t mean they are not extroverted in the slightest; people can be a mix of one and the other.
          <br><br>
    As studies progressed, scientists explored the correlation between one’s physical figure and their natural being. This was super weird to think that people are a certain way because of the shape of their physical appearance.
